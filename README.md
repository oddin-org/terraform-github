> Basic structure for our repos and members.

## Repositories

We won't be going too deep into anything more specific of a single repo, all we want is to have a single place where anyone can create a new repo that has the same main branch as everyone else. That task we leave to the [Settings Bot](https://github.com/probot/settings) so everyone can be autonomous of their prefered workflow.

The basic setup of a repo consists of a name with an optional description and topics, along with the setup for `main` branch as the default branch. Those are the only things that we MUST keep centralized here.
